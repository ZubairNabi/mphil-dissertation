{\Huge \bf Acknowledgements}

\vspace{24pt} 
First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisors, Dr Steven Hand and Dr
Anil Madhavapeddy, for their guidance and stimulation throughput the course of
this work. Dr Hand was instrumental in transforming a rough idea into a
full-fledged framework. His emphasis on a sound evaluation motivated me to look
at every system artifact from the point of view of an eventual experiment. Dr
Madhavapeddy even helped with minute operating system, virtualization and
networking internals.

This work would be nowhere without the insight provided into CIEL internals by
Malte Schwarzkopf, Derek Murray, and Chris Smowton. In addition, Dr Kenneth
Birman (Cornell) deserves a mention for his help and patience while I wrestled
with Isis2 and Mono.

Furthermore, friends who have made Cambridge into a wonderful experience for me
-- socially, academically, and intellectually -- merit my special gratitude.
Especially, Natalie Dobson for being a constant source of inspiration and
energy. My coursemates in the MPhil Advanced Computer Science have also never
ceased to amaze me with their aptitude and support.

Finally, I would like to thank my family who form the rock on which I balance my
existence. I dedicate this dissertation to them.
